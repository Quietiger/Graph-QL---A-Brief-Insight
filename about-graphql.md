# About GraphQL

Computing in these days is about getting meaningful data the databases. Initially it started from solving mathematical problems which is problem solving capacity and later on evolved on data processing which led to discover new and new methods to collect data from users and storing them for later processing \(Data Warehousing\)  and the overhead led to processing of it \(Data Mining\)  and now the real issue is **how to get that data to end users quickly and also in less cost effective manner.**

Storage technology evolved quickly and now we have variety of means viz., SQL, NOSQL, JSON etc.., and there are few vendors who still use legacy storage technologies. hence we needed a independent interpreter who can talk to all of these technologies and not to compromise the performance.

Face Book was having lots of overhead on satisfying customer needs as the application used a lot data from different sources like feeds, lists etc.. which needed a lot of bandwidth to fetch this data and the application also used more computing power from client side. Hence they decided to come up with a technology which solves them this problem, that idea led in development of GraphQL.

Instead of opting for a revolutionary storage structure or changing the workflow of the application they developed a technology which outlines a syntax which knows how and what data to ask for \(kind of one based on need to satisfy only whats been asked which contradicts the REST API as it fetches unnecessary data when an URL end point is called for a service.

In a application data model a client is empowered by letting the ask for the data for only what they need by following a syntax. This syntax is called GraphQL.

GraphQL is a query language for API's which can be used on existing data, which describes/understands data with its unique type system which work on variety of data sources. 

Unlike REST API, GraphQL overcomes REST APIs limitations by fetching only what is needed which makes GraphQL faster effective, fast and also makes application to run effectively on low powered devices. which makes GraphQL as a smart  endpoint.
